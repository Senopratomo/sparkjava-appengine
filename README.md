# sparkjava-appengine
Starter template for building Sparkjava on Google App Engine Java

This is a template project to get me started with building SparkJava app on Google app engine
It gave two simple REST endpoint (which you can modify and add some more for your own need).

Simply:
1) git clone the project
2) run 'mvn appengine:run' to run locally
3) run 'mvn appengine:deploy' to deploy to your GAE instance

Enjoy cheers!
